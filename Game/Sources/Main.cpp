IDEAS:

The theme is "Running out of space!"
Where do I even begin? D:

Idea 1:
-Escape a sinking ship?
 -Water is taking up all the space?!
 -Too short of a game?
 -Borrrinnnggg...

 // Its decided!?
Idea 2:
-Tample run like game
 -You try to avoid picking up items
  -If your inventory gets full you loose.
  -You can use some items?
   -Potions
    -Speed
	-Slowness
	-All potions give you an empty bottle when used.
   -Backpack?
    -More space!
  -Fun?, Wierd, Unique-ish...
  ---- Details ----
  -Tile based
  -Points
   -Time/Distance based
   -Buy more inventory space?

   -Also avoid... 
    -obsticles?
    -Enemies? Perhaps not.
